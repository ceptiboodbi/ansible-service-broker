- Display styles per viewport with dynamic legends, north arrows and scales. You can apply different display styles to different viewports in a layout and automatically generate legends, north arrows and scales that match the display style settings. This makes it easier to create professional-looking maps and drawings.
- Symbol editing. You can edit symbols for Map 3D more easily with the new Symbol Editor. You can create and modify symbols from scratch or use existing symbols as templates. You can also preview symbols before applying them to your data.
- Topobase functionality on SQL Server. You can use Map 3D (formerly Topobase/Enterprise) on SQL Server as well as Oracle. This gives you more flexibility and choice in managing your industry models.
- Convert to industry model. You can convert your existing drawings or data sources into industry models that support specific workflows and standards. For example, you can convert a DWG file into a water network model or a shapefile into a gas network model.
- Edit set. You can create and manage edit sets that contain a subset of features from an industry model. Edit sets allow you to work on specific areas or tasks without affecting the rest of the model.
