One of the main features of the update is the addition of two new ships: the Svalbard and the Selfy. The Svalbard is a large and modern crab boat that can carry up to 60 crab pots and has a powerful crane for hauling them in. The Selfy is a smaller and cheaper boat that can carry up to 20 crab pots and has a manual crane for lifting them. Both boats have different advantages and disadvantages, so you can choose the one that suits your playstyle and budget.
 
Another feature of the update is the new fishing mechanic for catching king crabs. You can now load up cages into your boat and search for the best breeding grounds for the biggest catch. You can use sonar, radar and GPS to locate the crabs, and then drop the cages into the water. After a while, you can return to collect your catch, but be careful not to lose your pots or damage them with icebergs or storms. You can also optimize your haul with two new mini games: use the crane to haul in the crab pots, and separate the male crabs from the female crabs to ensure that the local population remains healthy.
 
The update also fixes some issues with the game, such as improving the performance and stability, fixing some bugs with the UI and controls, and adding some new achievements and languages. You can find more details about the update on the official website of the game or on Steam.
 
Fishing Barents Sea King Crab Update v1.3.4.3406 is a free update for those who already own the game and the King Crab DLC. If you don't have them yet, you can buy them on Steam or other platforms for a reasonable price. Fishing Barents Sea King Crab is a realistic and immersive fishing simulation game that will challenge your skills and knowledge as a fisherman. If you are looking for a relaxing and rewarding game experience, you should give it a try.

## Fishing Barents Sea King Crab Update v1.3.4.3406: How to Play?
 
If you are new to Fishing Barents Sea King Crab, you might be wondering how to play the game and what are the main features and mechanics. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started and enjoy the game.
 
The game is divided into two modes: free roam and career. In free roam mode, you can choose any boat and location and fish as much as you want without any restrictions or goals. In career mode, you start with a small boat and a limited budget and have to work your way up by completing missions, earning money, buying new boats and equipment, hiring crew members, and managing your finances and quotas.
 
The game offers a variety of fishing methods, such as line fishing, net fishing, longline fishing, and crab fishing. Each method requires different equipment, skills, and strategies. You can use the map and the sonar to find the best fishing spots and see the fish density and species. You can also use the radar and the GPS to navigate the sea and avoid obstacles and dangers. You can also customize your boat with different colors, decals, lights, and accessories.
 
When you catch fish or crabs, you have to store them in your boat's hold or in cages. You can then sell them at the port or at a fish factory for different prices depending on the demand and quality. You can also buy fuel, bait, ice, food, and other supplies at the port or at a shop. You can also repair your boat, upgrade your equipment, pay your crew, take loans, or pay fines at the port.
 
The game features a dynamic day-night cycle and a realistic weather system that affects the sea conditions and the fish behavior. You have to adapt to different seasons, temperatures, winds, waves, currents, storms, icebergs, and fog. You also have to take care of your health and stamina by eating, drinking, sleeping, and staying warm. You can also interact with other fishermen on the radio or visit different locations on land.
 
The game also has a tutorial mode that teaches you the basics of fishing and navigation. You can also access a journal that shows you your progress, statistics, achievements, missions, contracts, licenses, quotas, crew members, boats, equipment, fish species, locations, tips, and settings. You can also adjust the difficulty level, the graphics quality, the sound volume, the controls scheme, and other options in the settings menu.
